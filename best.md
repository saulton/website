###Best

<blockquote>I would like, instead, to be concerned with the question "What is best?", a question which cuts deeply rather than broadly, a question whose answers tend to move the silt downstream. - Robert M. Pirsig</blockquote>

####Places

+  [Essaouira, Morocco](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Essaouira) (when you get in the cab from Marrakech, be sure to pronounce the r firmly otherwise you'll end up in Essouaila like an idiot, and you will be hot and mad and not at the beach) I learned to surf in Essaouira. Jimi Hendrix did, too. Or, anyway. He played guitar there.
+  [Kyoto, Japan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyoto) Skip the temples and shrines. Find the hippie van with the tent in the back.
+  [Yokohama, Japan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yokohama) I opened my yoga studio and lived in Yokohama for three years. That doesn't make me an expert, but it does make me deeply familiar. If you're visiting, ping me for specific-to-you recs.
+  [Dingle Peninsula Ireland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dingle_peninsula) Here there be faeries.
+  **New York City**  
+  [Sevilla, Spain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sevilla,_Spain). If you roll into Spain from Morocco (Tangiers), you'll take a water taxi type thing. The Moroccan crowd is not accustomed to traveling on water. Prepare for puke in the bathroom. Pack appropriate footwear.
+  [Sayulita, Mexico](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sayulita) Ask for Tigre on the beach if you want to learn SUP or how to surf. Ask for Jenn if you want a beautiful hand-made necklace. She'll probably be in Chiapas. If she's in town, she'll have a curly-headed little girl with her. Take tea tree oil with you.
+  [Nusa Lemongan, Bali](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nusa_Lembongan) This was the first time I snorkeled. I'm spoiled for life. If you visit, you'll see why.
+  **Trier, Germany** Bub just reminded me that when he and my grandmother came to visit when I lived in the UK, we went to Germany. And I made us circle through Trier a second time on our trip. Amazing place.

+  One pair of shoes. [Minimus from NB](http://www.rei.com/product/845514/new-balance-mt10v2-minimus-trail-running-shoes-mens). You can probably walk a billion miles in them.

####Books

Everything I own fits into one bag. I travel best when I travel light. What's best? I'll list it here.

I don't get paid to recommend. If something improves your life and you'd like to say thanks, [gittip](http://gittip.com/gwenbell) me.
