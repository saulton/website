###Stoicism and the Art of Computer Maintenance

Thinking on LevelDB and this from Dominic Tarr:

and [this interview with Jaron Lanier](http://spectrum.ieee.org/podcast/computing/networks/jaron-lanier-were-being-enslaved-by-free-information).

Just realized I hit [1,000 commits](http://github.com/gwenbell) on my birthday. I mean, moments under the wire. Haha. Pretty rad.

Listening to Sigur Ros. A breeze is picking up. Terminal Tweaks has gorgeousified my work environment. Arch, Gnome, Terminal Tweaks in that order if you're wanting to take on that challenge. Started giving $1/wk to [Derp/Dansup](https://www.gittip.com/dansup/), for Hyperboria and Socialnode.

It could always be worse.

Come say hi in #bitters on Freenode if you do the IRC thing.

Woke up earlyish. Fired up Acer. Logged in, then nothing. Ok, something. A grey screen. No mouse action, no cursor. 

Reboot. Logged in as root. 

Deleted Cinnamon. Reinstalled Gnome. That did the trick. Oh, and deleted and recreated user account. 

Learning Pacman.

It's a bit like NPM. Also, Vim. Which is nothing like Pacman or NPM but the more Vim I learn the more the other two and pretty much everything else makes sense.

I'm watching the treeline. I'm writing to you on a new Acer. It took four days to get Arch Linux on it and now I'm watching the treeline, the sun setting behind it and the spider whose web has grown into a wild thing the past few days. I finished Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance. 

On the way to Arch on the Acer, bricked a MacBook Air. I don't miss it. I missed machines in the past, especially the black MacBook. 

Over the past two years I've grown sick of the Mac OSX spyware updates and then, once I got it on the Air, the Ubuntu 13.04 spyware updates. And now that I'm on Arch Linux, I can be concerned with the spider webs and the treeline again. And know nobody's peeking into my operating system.

Which yes, is a relief.

What now? We're all up to speed on privacy and the web. Now what do we do about it?

+ The past 72 hours, I've been experiencing some SMTP technical difficulties. I've been able to receive, but sometimes unable to send, email messages. This is interesting. I don't see anyone talking about it, so it could be an isolated problem. Here's my workaround. It's based on this [comment](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5985720). I number outgoing email messages. So, I say, this is message 2/2, with your first email being one and this one being two. And I say the day and time of day I sent it.

+ I've started asking for acknowledgment of receipt. This is a radical shift from how I used email even a year ago. I asked my readers to sign off NRN, or no response needed, if they didn't expect a response. Now, I am asking for the opposite. If you emailed with a direct question in the past week and I didn't respond, assume I didn't receive - and send the message again.

+ I'm back on Hyperboria. Read up on that [here](https://github.com/cjdelisle/cjdns). If you want to talk, we can talk in there or on IRC. I'll see you in gittip or stackvm.

+ Because of the weirdness of email and mail providers like MailChimp, I'm doing this the old fashioned way. I'll keep adding links to the front page of this site.  

+ Just watched this [funny video](http://t.co/27wlbJ6H) of Chad about Gittip, which he used to call Git Tip, two words, and now he calls Gittip all run together. You might understand it better after you watch him describe it. Also, appears he has at least [one hundred children](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZtJZaVI4sA&feature=share&list=PLB86F67086C6856F8).

+ I'm so happy and calm being back on a Linux box. I think Ubuntu 13.04 is pretty great as of right now. Also, I'm glad I know Git and am learning Vim, because this threesome is a powerful combination: Linux, Git and Vim. If you don't know Git, you don't know shit.

Yesterday I submitted a story to HN for the first time. [This story](http://t.co/ZWveqzFzzI). It went to the front of the site and stayed there all day. I had 1 karma point at the start of the day... and nearly 300 just 24 hours later. 

Wild. Learned a lot on the Node front, fast. Thankful to Substack and Substack's buddy, Peter, for helping out. Proud of Ev for writing the article that went to the front page, and handling the sudden influx like a pro. 

**4 July 2013**

Got a message from Chad Whitacre, head people and code wrangler at [Gittip](http://www.gittip.com). I made it onto the team somehow. Which is exciting and weird and touching. Well, first I felt touched. Because I've joined the company of people I respect, admire and want to be more like as a programmer.

This week I started learning Vim. I got some [magic potions from Zed Shaw](https://twitter.com/gwenbell/status/351545304857849856), and several suggestions to use [Vim Adventures](http://vim-adventures.com/), which dulls the pain. 

On the Gittip front, I'm now earning enough to say I'm earning a portion of my living on Gittip. That's amazing. I'm grateful to be able to do the work, and know that even when it takes me down forks I can't describe or teach yet, which is normal, I am nonetheless supported.

I believe that's the brilliance of Gittip. The ongoing streaming income frees me up to think about and work on harder problems. If you're one of the quiet, anonymous supporters, thank you.
