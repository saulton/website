Presence
--------

_Presence was a limited-time offering. It's no longer for sale. If you'd like to support the work I do, contribute to this distributed genius grant with [gittip](http://gittip.com/gwenbell)._

### What is presence?

Presence is everything you need to unhook from digital drama, delete what you don't need anymore, take a digital sabbatical, mourn the loss of old technologies and lay the foundation to learn harder tech skills, like Git and Node.

It's a distillation of the best I've offered over the past three years. The journey starts in Boulder, Colorado and ends in Brooklyn, New York.

### Terminal

#### Gwen Bell | June 2013

I talk with faeries and dead people. Maybe that's why when you poogle me it auto-fills to 'gwen bell crazy'. Well, if I'm crazy, that's great but please, I implore you, give that search engine up for [duckduckgo](http://duckduckgo.com). 

I like reporting back what I hear on the astral plane. I did that in Terminal. Biggie Smalls visited. I interviewed my mom. Steve Jobs wrote the intro. Shit's real, yo.

In its own weird way, Terminal offers the why of computing as you read the how of [Git Commit](http://git.gwenbell.com). I cover thirty days on the command line/terminal in Git Commit. Before you even approach the terminal, you have to have some idea why it exists and why it matters.

Terminal is a philosophical reflection on why it, and we, are here.

### Digital Warriorship II

#### Gwen Bell | June 2012

The second version of Digital Warriorship features new experiments in paying better, closer attention.

### Reverb

#### Gwen Bell | March 2012

Reverb started as #best09 in 2009 and became #reverb10 in 2010. From hundreds of participants in the first year, to thousands in year two, the project reverberated through the web. It generated over 1,000 pages of tweets in just one month. Reverb's the story of how that, and other successful reverberations, happened.

### Attention Detox

#### Gwen Bell | Jan 2012

An Attention Detox helps you keep track of your attention for 168 hours. It's guaranteed to bring into focus how distracted you are, and what you need to do reclaim your attention.

The original version included a guided version - I watched, shared observations and guided participants. The attention detox included with Presence is self-guided.

### Digital Warriorship

#### Gwen Bell | Feb 2011

To be present for others, first see and hear yourself. 

Align your real self with your digital self. My path from scrolling for empathy to taking digital sabbaticals. This was my first paid offering. An introduction to start developing your presence.

I would never have become a programmer if I hadn't done the things that I rolled into _Presence_. It's every conversation, every experiment, every resource - everything I used to get to where I am now, doing what I love every day.

I've phased out Presence to focus on deeper technical skills. If you'd like to financially support this work, please do so by giving to this [distributed genius grant](https://www.gittip.com/gwenbell/).
