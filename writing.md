####Shut it Down - a note from [Roslynn Tellvik](https://twitter.com/RoslynnTellvik) 

i loved reverb. i want to read presence and terminal. i will git commit at some point. thank you for writing them all. you'll get to 500/wk on gittip. i wish it was by the support of more women but that's only because i wish more women were showing up and shutting it down. write whatever you want.

i'm going to nyc next week. you mention nyc in your emails. i feel more connected to the city because of that which is cool. thanks.

i'm starting a business with my lover. we are making botanical syrups for sparkling water and cocktails because people settle for sweet things but they need real things. why can't you have both? and drinks are fun to make and share. i am doing the storytelling and ambassadoring. she is the food scientist with a family background in chinese herbal medicine.

you wrote about <a href="/writing#genius">total buy-in</a>. i fucking needed to hear that. and i was like, why does gwen bell's writing make me want to read more and more? and then i was like, because she doesn't baby or bullshit you and you can totally take it. and then you feel stronger and then you are clearer.

i'm a long way (but a short time) from flowing-spring-clear. i want to get there. it's in me to be that. my inner faerie badass told me this morning that the way from here to there is action. do something. say something. that resonates. i'm tired of holding in waiting for external buy-in. it's boring and wearying. i'm scared too. what will i think? who cares? no really, who cares? if I care what I think then I'm sure I'll work something out with myself. haha

so yeah, i want to read presence. and terminal. in the meantime i'll read the war of art. and commit. cuz i'm ready to own my own stack. starting with truth.

shut it down gwen bell.

**This note shared with permission from Roslynn Tellvik. Shut it Down refers to this 16 June 2013 letter:**

I was standing in the living room of The Schoolhouse. This platinum-haired pixie of a woman, about my height, about my weight, about my intensity, with elaborate eye sprinkles on crashes into the room, "I'm shutting this place down," she says to nobody in particular.

I look around. Nobody seemed alarmed but me. I was all, "damn, the party must be good for it to get shut down by a faerie princess."

No, she wasn't an undercover. She was about to go on stage on the next level up of The Schoolhouse. She was assuring everyone present she was about to shut it the fuck down.

Someone pinged me yesterday about how to grow her audience. I said get off Tumblr. She was all, duh, I knew that. And what I was saying, and am saying is, shut it down. Like, close down all the shitty websites you no longer update. Kill off your Tumblr. Destroy all those precious selfies you got up on Instagram. Shut it down.

Then, you won't have to ask my advice about how to shut it down. You will walk into whatever room you next enter and you will say, "I'm shutting this place down," and then, you will.

In case you haven't noticed, I'm shutting it down on Gittip. And before the end of the weekend, I'm going to break three digits. Trip, trip, trip. Get in there because you're going to want to be able to say, "I was there, and Gwen Bell shut it down."

####Polylog

Last night I sat in front of a fire at a rooftop dance party at [The Schoolhouse](http://brooklyn-spaces.com/2011/09/the-schoolhouse/) in Bushwick, New York. I was drinking a Weihenstephan, the world's oldest beer. I let the bass from the dj's speakers vibrate me. 

As I listened and drank and watched the fire, I interviewed someone, the artist who has the claw-footed bath tub in his bedroom. When he walks into a room, clothes start dropping. 

I wanted to know his secret, so I asked for an interview. As we talked, his arm draped around my shoulder, the smell of his sweat mixing with mine, it was just. So. 

I derive pleasure from other people's pleasure. In the poly world, there's a word for it. It's called **compersion**.

Though I'm not currently in, nor actively seeking a poly relationship, I have been 1/3 of a poly relationship. I was intrigued as I read about compersion, because I feel it so often and in all my reading and travels, I'd never heard of it. 

I think compersion is **the** secret the mainstream monogamous community doesn't want you to know about. As though the mono culture will break when you derive pleasure from someone else's pleasure. 

Instead, it focuses on drama and jealousy. Two indicators there's a paucity of people and pleasure, and you gotta fight for what's yours. I say there's _more than enough_. There is no _yours_.

So, let's focus on compersion, the other side of the coin.

<hr />

Compersion. There was this time in Sayulita, Mexico when I watched this woman add cream to her coffee. Her hair was long and bleached blonde, and her dining partner had his arm around her shoulders and a little girl played at her feet. She had about twenty-three bracelets on her left wrist. She was wearing sunglasses. There is no way I could ever pull off that look, nor would I necessarily want to. 

Instead, I enjoyed her enjoying herself.

As I watched her take that first sip of her coffee, there at the restaurant. I felt it. I mean, of course, I can't feel what she feels, but I felt **compersion** Just seeing her delight, her love directed at that child, her excitement with her partner, and the delicious coffee to boot.

<hr />

I wish we talked about compersion more. Rappers rap a lot about jealousy, and recently I've talked about it, too. But I don't do jealousy. I almost never experience jealousy. I do compersion. I feel _that_ daily.

The polylog is a dedication to all the things that turn me on. My turn ons are legion.

There's a section or two on compersion in [The Ethical Slut](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ethical_Slut). If you want some new sources of pleasure, or at least tittilating conversation, buy a copy and read that book in public.

<hr />

After the conversation with the artist on how he turns the room on, I had a conversation with a fellow developer. I asked him questions, too. He had a harder time getting at what brings him pleasure. He wasn't even sure which programming languages he enjoyes programming in. 

So, I'm bringing two worlds I respect together here. The analytical world on the terminal needs access to this world of pleasure. You could start a pleasure log if you want. Or just take a little pleasure from the pleasure I take. Practice compersion.

####The Genius in You; or, Total Buy-in

**What if you could let the part of your brain stamped EARN rest for a while? Or forever?**

I watched Synecdoche, New York. Then I walked from Brooklyn to Manhattan as the sun set. I walked a total of 16,557 steps, which according to my nano watch was 7.83 miles. I saw four condoms in various states of used. I saw two people sleeping on the street. I witnessed a woman with platinum hair run from one end to the other and back in the time it took me to get to the end of the Williamsburg bridge.

[Ev](http://evbogue.com) suggested Synecdoche because he knows my love for intense programming. 

The other reason Ev suggested Synecdoche is since the start of the week I've given a lot of thought to genius grants. These things actually exist. They're called MacArthur Fellowships. It's all anonymous, which is also true for [Gittip](http://gittip.com). I view Gittip as distributed, peer-to-peer genius grants. Lots of people supporting each other financially so they can work on and do what they love. Those who have more to give, contribute more. Those who are doing the work and need more support, get more.

In Synecdoche, the main character, Caden Cotard (played by Philip Seymour Hoffman) is given one such genius grant. Though in his case it's not distributed. It's a lump-sum from higher up, rather than little bits from lots of people. His is vertical to Gittip's horizontal. He goes from getting by to having so much income he can do whatever he wants with his time and never thinks about earning again. 

He lets the part of his brain stamped EARN take a permanent vacation.

Sounds great! But when you think about it, especially if you've watched The Wire, you know what I mean when I say The Hustle gives you Purpose. The drive to get some product out the door gives you laser-like focus, and without the boundaries of 'you're running out of cashmoney', you've got to get that pushback from _somewhere_.

Caden Cotard is tragic - not semi-tragic, not kinda pathetic melancholy in an Eternal Sunshine kinda way. No, I find him flat-out tragic. This play he's making, funded by the genius grant, goes on for most of eternity, and I don't want to spoil the plot, but there's really no saving graces to this guy. I keep wanting for there to be. But with unlimited funding, it's like he has a permanent case of The Resistance.

If you read my work during 2011 and 2012, you know I got obsessed with The Resistance. After I read _The War of Art_ I started seeing The Resistance everywhere, in everybody, including myself. I couldn't _not_ see it. I was grateful Steven Pressfield had written, finally, the truth about getting things into the world. 

Pressfield covered, in a slim volume, basically every kind of cop out, every excuse I had for not doing the work. Once I got to the end I was all, 'huh. I've done every single one of these things. Now that I know about the Resistance, I'll aim to never have it again!' 

That has almost, but not quite, worked out. 

Caden has The Resistance (which, by the way, is contagious), but there's something more pernicious at play. He spends the duration of the film trying to get buy-in. From anybody. His wife, his second wife, his daughter, the people in the play he's staging. He wants them to say: you're an alright kinda guy Caden. You're doing your best. And even when they _do_ say that, he never takes it to heart. He keeps berating himself, wishing he could get _total buy-in_ from _the whole world_. Failing that, he keeps plugging on this play, trying to get _it_ perfect. (Trying to get it perfect is a symptom of the Resistance. You have to hit publish, even if you think it's shit, which you always will. Think it's shit, that is.)

**The only person who can give you total buy-in on your life is you.**

There's no pleasure to this guy's life. He's so caught up in his own _dukkha_ (dissatisfaction in Buddhist), he can't see straight. Sure, he fucks but it's always sad. You know, like he's hoping he could perform a little better. He's weepy and self-absorbed. (Contrast that with self-contained.) 

He never merges with his lover. He holds her at arm's length, wanting, you guessed it. 

Total buy-in.

The only person who will give you total buy-in is you. That's why when someone says to me, 'Oh, I could never write like you do. My life's not that interesting,' I take them at their word. 

I see they haven't bought into their own story.

This isn't to say you don't have to drop the story-_line_. My work isn't just in telling masturbatory stories I like to write that you'll like to read. It's also unplugging for two years to listen to my own voice. To discover whether what I'm telling you is true is true for me, or is it just what you (they, the group/collective) want to hear.

Returning after two years away, I'm clearer now on my voice than I was when I left. And. It turns out, the voice isn't that much different. It's oh! Here I am. And I'm not a whole lot different than when I blank-slated.

Which. Is why I blank the slate. What remains after you blank the slate is as close to true as you're going to get. And you're never going to get to total blank. 

You will never come out clean.

That is what I love about Six Feet Under. None of those characters come out clean, and still, I forgive each of them. I forgive them their foibles and 'shortcomings'. 

I forgive the parts of them I thought I couldn't forgive in myself.

They remind me I can let myself off the hook. Caden _never_ lets himself off the hook. He _never_ builds his pleasure palette. He never takes stock of what brings him geniune pleasure.

And I wonder if that's because _he never bottoms out_. I've bottomed out so many times now. I chuckle when I think about them. I don't think my mini-tragedies are actually all that tragic. Yes, of course, hard at the time. Yes, if you're going through hell keep going. But maybe it was during these past two years during a self-chosen exile that showed me: it could always be worse. And it has made pleasure _that much easier_ to touch each moment.

I didn't always say that. I used to say, "this is the worst thing of all time!" High drama. I'd fling myself on the couch and have a cry for the afternoon.

But when I turn anything on its head and say, "it could always be worse," and "what's the worst that could happen here?" I see the situation differently. That difference, though slim, hasn't just once saved my life. It _keeps_ saving my life.

Whether you think mine is a life worth living means not a whit to me. 

Because the person who has to demonstrate total buy-in is me.

And I do.
